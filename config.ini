input_file_path : 'input/2DMSMS_CASI_CID_P11_CHO_09_26_2021.xlsx' # Path to the input file containing MS/MS spectra.

multiple : 4 # multiple of each neutral loss to consider to find the next peak.
tolerance : 3 # fragment tolerance for generating pathways.
nominal_tolerance : 1 # fragments within +-nominal_tolerance Da will be considered precursors.
